Project originally for the course os1. This client is intended to work from RasPi and send data to mqtt broker from the RasPi. This particular version works on envirophat but it could be easily modified to send any kind of data.

You need to install paho.mqtt to your venv. 

```
pip install paho.mqtt
```

Remember to set your broker variable as well as username and password.
